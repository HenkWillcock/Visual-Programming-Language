# Awesome Programming Language

## 1 Built In Objects

### 1.1 String

Any string of characters is a string.

### 1.2 Integer

Integers are recognised as numbers with no decimal point. Integers extend strings, so anything a string can do an integer can also do.

### 1.3 Floating Point

Decimals are recognised as numbers with a decimal point. Decimals extend strings, so anything a string can do a decimal can also do.

## 2 Blocks

### 2.1 Conditional

#### Structure

```
if: <boolean>
then: <method>
else: <method> (Optional)
```

### 2.2 Multi Conditional

A multi conditional can have additional conditions, each with an associated method.

#### Structure

```
if <boolean>
then <method>
else if <boolean>
then <method>
else <method> (Optional)
```

### 2.2 Conditional Loop

#### Structure

```
while <boolean>
do <method>
```

### 2.3 Repeat Loop

#### Structure

```
repeat <integer> 
times <method>
```

### 2.4 Iterate Loop

#### Structure

```
with <data-structure>
do <method>
```

## 3 Actions

An action takes an input and perform an action, either changing the internal state of the program or producing I/O. Methods don't return outputs.

## 4 Functions

A function takes an input and returns outputs. Functions aren't allowed to change the state of the program or produce I/O.

## 5 Data Structures

### 5.1 List

### 5.2 Set

## 6 Custom Objects

In APL, everything is an object. This includes basic data types, data structures, functions and methods.
