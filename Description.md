## 1 Built In Objects

### 1.1 String

Any string of characters is a string.

### 1.2 Integer

Integers are recognised as numbers with no decimal point. Integers extend strings, so anything a string can do an integer can also do.

### 1.3 Floating Point

Decimals are recognised as numbers with a decimal point. Decimals extend strings, so anything a string can do a decimal can also do.

## 2 Blocks

### 2.1 Conditional

#### Structure

```

```

### 2.2 Multi Conditional

A multi conditional can have additional conditions, each with an associated method.

#### Structure

```
**if:** Condition
**then:** Method
**else if:** Condition

### 2.2 While Loop

#### Components

* Condition
* Method

### 2.3 For Loop

#### Components

* Initialisation
* Condition
* Increment
* Method

## 3 Methods

A method takes an input and performs actions, either changing the internal state of the program or producing I/O. Methods don't return outputs.

### 4 Functions

A function takes an input and returns outputs. Functions aren't allowed to change the state of the program.

## 5 Data Structures

### 5.1 List

### 5.2 Set

## 6 Custom Objects

In APL, everything is an object. This includes basic data types, data structures, functions and methods.
